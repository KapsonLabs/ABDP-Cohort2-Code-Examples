## Smart Contract Security


Smart Contracts are "Immutable" and also deal with financial instruments. Although the blockchain secures transactions through cryptography and the power of a distributed network, a dApps security is only as good as the deployed code executing its instructions.

It is therefore extremely important to follow some basic security guidelines and do as much testing as possible before deploying whilst keeping the code as simple as possible.

Ethereum and dApps are highly experimental which means news bugs and security risks can be discovered, so its important to keep up with new developments.
