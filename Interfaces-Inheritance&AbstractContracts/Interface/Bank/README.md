# Interfaces and Their Application

Interfaces are like abstract contracts, but there are differences. Interfaces cannot contain any definition.
They can only contain function declarations. It means functions in interfaces cannot contain any code.
They are also known as pure abstract contracts. An interface can contain only the signature of functions.
